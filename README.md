This project multiplies dragon health by 1.5 as well as the amount of players to balance the fight if playing with friends, or even if you are by yourself because the dragon fight is WAY too easy nowadays.

Download the project as a zip and put it in your datapack folder
or head to https://github.com/mcneds/dragon_health_modifer/releases to download the spigot plugin
